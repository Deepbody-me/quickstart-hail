default parameters builds the following {partner-product-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

After the Hail Service Catalog portfolio is deployed, you can spin up notebook instances and {partner-product-name} clusters that can talk to each other through Sparkmagic and Livy.

As shown in figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A {partner-product-name} AWS Service Catalog portfolio, allowing you to create and manage your own Hail clusters.
* Four AWS CodeBuild pipelines to support building various combinations of Hail 0.2.x releases, Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) versions, and Loss-Of-Function Transcript Effect Estimator (LOFTEE) plug-ins.
* An Amazon SageMaker instance that lets you stand up and tear down JupyterLab notebook environments that integrate with Hail clusters (through Sparkmagic and Livy).
* An Amazon EMR cluster that lets you stand up and tear down {partner-product-name} clusters as needed.
* An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) Sagemaker bucket to back up launched notebook environments.
* An Amazon S3 bucket for staging Hail artifacts.
* An optional VPC configured with a private subnet, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.
