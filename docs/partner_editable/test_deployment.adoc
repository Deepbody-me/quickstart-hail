Choose the IAM users/roles/groups that you want to grant the ability to launch {partner-product-name} clusters or Notebooks. For example, if you are giving access to an IAM user, even though you launched the catalog, you still must explicitly grant yourself permissions this way. Don’t forget to grant yourself access.
