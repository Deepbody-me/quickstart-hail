This Quick Start, built in collaboration with Privo IT, simplifies building, managing, and interacting with {partner-product-name} clusters in your AWS account. {partner-product-name} is an open-source library built for Apache Spark to enable scalable data exploration and analysis, with a particular emphasis on genomics.

Using {partner-product-name}, researchers can perform genomic analysis more quickly and efficiently. {partner-product-name} makes it easy to use Spark programming techniques to process genetic data (Genomic Dataframes). It also simplifies dealing with multiple input formats by unifying into a common data structure (Hail MatrixTable). 

This Quick Start uses Amazon EMR to power {partner-product-name} with Apache Spark to scale large datasets horizontally across numerous instances, including large production-scale genome‚Äêwide association studies (GWAS) computation or single-node ad-hoc processing. 

{partner-product-name} is maintained by a team in the https://www.nealelab.is[Neale] lab at the https://www.broadinstitute.org/stanley[Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research] of the https://www.broadinstitute.org/[Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard] and the https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/[Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit] of https://www.massgeneral.org[Massachusetts General Hospital].
This Quick Start packages {partner-product-name} into your AWS environment and makes it easy to spin up clusters and integrated Notebooks for analysis.
