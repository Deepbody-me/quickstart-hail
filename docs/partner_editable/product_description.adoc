This Quick Start, built with collaboration from Privo IT, simplifies building, managing, and interacting with Hail clusters in your AWS account. Hail is an open-source library built for Apache Spark to enable scalable data exploration and analysis, with a particular emphasis on genomics.

Hail makes it easy to use Spark programming techniques to process genetic data (Genomic Dataframes) and simplifies dealing with multiple input formats by unifying into a common data structure (Hail MatrixTable). Using Hail, researchers can perform genomic analysis more quickly and efficiently.

This Quick Start uses Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) to power Hail with Apache Spark to scale large datasets horizontally across numerous instances, including large production-scale genome‚Äêwide association studies (GWAS) computation or single-node ad-hoc processing. 

Hail is maintained by a team in the https://www.nealelab.is[Neale] lab at the https://www.broadinstitute.org/stanley[Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research] of the https://www.broadinstitute.org/[Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard] and the https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/[Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit] of https://www.massgeneral.org[Massachusetts General Hospital].
This Quick Start packages Hail into your AWS environment and makes it easy to spin up clusters and integrated Notebooks for analysis.
